# Continuous Time Stochastic Processes  

## Preliminaries

A **right continuous** stochastic process.  

There are three types of right continuous processes  

- **Normal**  

- **Absorption**

- **Explosion**  

The **jump times** are random variables  

The **holding times** are random variables defined as  

A **jump process**  

Compute probabilities using **countable union**  

A **counting process** is a stochastic process $\{N_t\}_{t\geq 0}$ satisfying  

- $N_0=0$

- $\forall t \geq 0, N_t \in \mathbb{N}_0$

- (Non-decreasing) If $0 \leq s \leq t$, $N_s \leq N_t$  

- (Counting)

- (Right continuous)   


A **counting process associatedt the sequence** $(J_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}$


## Poisson Processes  

A **Poisson process** is a non-decreasing stochastic process with nonnegative values satisfying  


An equivalent definition replaces the last condition
