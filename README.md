# Notes for College

This repository contains notes for some of the courses I have taken/ am currently taking. I have typed up most of the notes just for fun and a few for a better understanding of the course materials.  

Notes can be found in folders starting with `MATH` and a simple calculator using `Sage` can be found in the folder `Tools_For_TRA`.
